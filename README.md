### What I learned

Being my second Front End Mentor CSS challenge, I wanted to utilise this as practice implementing good class naming conventions, sensible container layouts, appropriate font styling and colour re-use with CSS custom properties. 

I also wanted to make this a mobile-first workflow, so styles are created for those dimensions foremost, and media queries are applied to larger devices (including desktop).

<h5><u>Main Challenge</u></h5>

- Planned out and implemented containers for all content
- Implemented CSS grid for mobile and desktop design
- Utilised and implemented the gradient styling for the results container
- Styled the card view on desktop, and adjusted the containers shaping on mobile
- Summary sub sections styled under a unified class, with separation for the individual colours for each sub section
- Active states implemented and final spacing tweaks

<h4><u>Code snippets of note</u></h4>

One of the few areas where I utilised nested CSS, but it worked for readability and with the separation of classes here, and it's clear what container and sub container this is pointing to.

```css
.section-container.green {
    background-color: hsl(166, 100%, 37%, 0.1);
    .verbal {
        color: var(--light-green);
    }
}
```
My first time utilising a responsive CSS grid, I wish I had more reason to explain why I'm proud of it, nevertheless it brings me joy and I'm looking forward using this more in future projects.

```css
.results-summary-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    ...
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .results-summary-container {
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
      ...
    }
}
```

### Continued development

For my first update, I want to complete the bonus objective, which is to utilise the JSON file to dynamically populate the summary content.
